        "description": "Pu'er or pu-erh[1] is a variety of fermented tea traditionally produced in Yunnan Province, China. In the context of traditional Chinese tea production terminology, fermentation refers to microbial fermentation (called 'wet piling'), and is typically applied after the tea leaves have been sufficiently dried and rolled.[2] As the tea undergoes controlled microbial fermentation, it also continues to oxidize, which is also controlled, until the desired flavors are reached. This process produces tea known as 黑茶 hēichá (lit. 'black tea') (which is different from the English-language black tea that is called 红茶 hóngchá (lit. 'red tea') in Chinese). Pu'er falls under a larger category of fermented teas commonly translated as dark teas. ",

        "description": "Genmaicha (玄米茶, brown rice tea) is a Japanese brown rice green tea consisting of green tea mixed with roasted popped brown rice.[1] It is sometimes referred to colloquially as popcorn tea because a few grains of the rice pop during the roasting process and resemble popcorn, or as people's tea, as the rice served as a filler and reduced the price of the tea, making it historically more available for poorer Japanese. Today all segments of society drink genmaicha.[2] It was also used by people fasting for religious purposes or who found themselves to be between meals for long periods of time.[2] ",

        "description": "Oolong (UK: /ˈuːlɒŋ/, US: /-lɔːŋ/; simplified Chinese: 乌龙茶; traditional Chinese: 烏龍茶 (wūlóngchá, dark dragon tea)) is a traditional semi-oxidized Chinese tea (Camellia sinensis) produced through a process including withering the plant under strong sun and oxidation before curling and twisting.[1] Most oolong teas, especially those of fine quality, involve unique tea plant cultivars that are exclusively used for particular varieties. The degree of oxidation, which varies according to the chosen duration of time before firing, can range from 8 to 85%,[2] depending on the variety and production style. Oolong is especially popular in south China and among ethnic Chinese in Southeast Asia[3] as is the Fujian preparation process known as the Gongfu tea ceremony. ",

The green tea plants used for matcha are shade-grown for three to four weeks before harvest; the stems and veins are removed during processing. During shaded growth, the plant Camellia sinensis produces more theanine and caffeine. The powdered form of matcha is consumed differently from tea leaves or tea bags, as it is suspended in a liquid, typically water or milk. ",
